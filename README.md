# films_and_models

Films_and_models is a responsive reactJS web application that consumes public API. It is designed primarily to display models and films in which they were featured in. 


# What it does

This is a dynamic web application that display names of models and titles of films available in database. Response is gotten from a public API. This application allows you to find out details about films and models when you click on any the 'details' button beneath each film or model.

An improvement on this version of the application will accept names of models or title of films in a search bar, check to see if they are available in the database, and returns data if available. In a case where data cannot be found, a message is sent to inform the user of the request error.

# How to use the web application

From the landing page, click on any of the tabs in the navigation bar to go to their respective pages. These pages each contains cards with brief information about what their names connote. For example, clicking on the 'Models' tab takes you to a new page that displays available models inside cards in grid form. To get more details about each model, click on the 'details' button in each card. This will take you to another page where details on the model clicked is displayed.

While in the desired page, you will see a couple of related films displayed below the model details. Hover your cursor on them to find out each link. Click on any of the links to find out more information about the film described in the link.
